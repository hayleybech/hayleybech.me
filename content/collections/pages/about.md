I'm a full-stack developer, singer and creator of [Choir Concierge](https://www.choirconcierge.com). I love Laravel, board games and Aussie music! I love making things that bring people joy. I'm also passionate about advocating for change, especially when it comes to queer and neurodivergent people, and mental health.
