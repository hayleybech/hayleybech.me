before ynab
- money anxiety despite being great at saving


what is ynab
- budget app that avoids the common forecasting pitfalls of other budget apps
- it's a fancy version of the envelope method
- it encourages you to stop looking at your entire bank balance, and start dividing that balance into smaller numbers with very specific purposes

the 4 rules
1. give every dollar a job
	- every single dollar. 
	- no "savings". 
	- all savings has a purpose, if you think real hard.
	- savings examples: 
		- going on a trip to Hawaii
		- regular vet bill
		- irregular vet emergency
		- in case of emergency
		- house deposit
2. 

now with ynab
- having a budget eased that anxiety but making priorities and costs clearer
- we're nerdy about it.
- we have categories for loads of things, like vet vs vet dental, or even a "lost my job insurance fund0"
