Making a side hustle is exhausting. It can be hard at times to just sit down and work on it, which is where a bit of well-placed accountability can be crucial.

Earlier this month, I attended She Codes' Cosy Coding Sunday, a session for relaxed co-working. It's hard to overestimate the value of occasionally getting out of the house and into a different, more focused environment. Especially when the people around you are there to accomplish the same thing. It was quiet, with just the right amount of chit-chat to feel welcomed but still get a lot of work done.

I met some wonderful people, all women working on exciting and unique projects. For example, Kate worked on a dress made of flashing lights, Selina worked on her [handmade outdoor pet urn](https://ashandearth.com.au/) business, and Nina worked on her [virtual tailoring service](https://madeapt.com/). Organised co-working like this is a form of Body Doubling. 

Body Doubling is a term from the ADHD community. It simply means either asking someone to be near you whilst being productive themselves, or even involving them in your own task somehow. I use it when I can, but since it depends on another person, you don't want to over-use this technique and put tension on your relationship with that person. A lot of forms of accountability work like body doubling - for example, a cosy coding Sunday is essentially body doubling in a larger group.

A partner, close friend or coworker could be an ideal body double. That said, this concept has become so popular that there are [now](https://www.cofocus.one/) [entire](https://www.flow.club/) [websites](https://www.deepwrk.io/) to [find body doubles](https://www.laramates.com/) (ok, that last link was a pair programming site for Laravel devs, but pair programming is basically the same thing. Plus, if you're reading this you might be a Laravel developer and should totally check it out).

I want to find more opportunities like this as I turn my attention to both new and existing projects. I thrive in an environment of friendly accountability, and I'm sure there are many of you that do too. Reach out if you want to know next time SheCodes hosts a Cosy Coding Sunday, or if you just want a quiet pair programming session.
