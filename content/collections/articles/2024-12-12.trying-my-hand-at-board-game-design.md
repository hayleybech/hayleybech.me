A while back, Victoria had the idea to turn one of her favourite book series - a series I've also come to enjoy - into a board game. I jumped in to collaborate and it has become a fun little experiment for the both of us. 

# The vision
The concept is to turn the Warrior Cats series into a strategy game, where you compete to have the strongest clan of cats in the forest. I've decided to loop you in at a very early stage in the design, so things are very much in flux. Who knows if we'll even get a viable prototype? That said, we have identified a few pillars that we think would make it a great game:
- The focus for the player should be on managing the clan as a whole, but with the potential to tell great stories.
- Combat between players will be possible, but the game will strongly encourage an "uneasy peace". 
- Victory conditions will require balancing the needs of your own clan -represented by a "strength" track - with the needs of other clans and a few narrative-based events - represented by a "Starclan's Favour" track.
- Much of the tension will come from food scarcity. When your food is plentiful, will you share it with other clans or save it for a rainy day? When food is running dangerously low, will you encroach on opponents' territory and risk starting a fight?
