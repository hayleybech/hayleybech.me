Hi!
Inspired by Zuzana's [30-in-30 challenge](https://www.zuzana-k.com/articles/write-30-in-30-challenge), I've also made a commitment to write 30 blog posts in 30 days! I'm starting with an overview of all things Hayley, which should give you an idea of what I'll be writing about and whether it's for you.

# Coding
I'm a full-stack Laravel developer at heart, but I also have a day job as a React dev working on the frontend for [HBF](https://hbf.com.au), the largest private health insurance company in Western Australia. I'm also the creator of [Choir Concierge](https://www.choirconcierge.com), a React + Inertia + Laravel + Tailwind (or TRIL) app that helps choirs learn their music and manage their day-to-day admin tasks. I have about 150 active singers in a handful of choirs in Australia and abroad, and I'm quite proud of the user experience the app is able to provide for users. I plan to go into detail about the history and plans for this app in future posts.

# Performing
I've been a performer for as long as I can remember, starting out in musical theatre, but these days I'm primarily a singer focusing on a cappella, especially in the Barbershop style. I'm an Assistant Musical Director and singer in [The Baden Street Singers](https://baden.st), a mixed-gender barbershop choir that has won the national medal here in Australia. I also sing in Barbershop quartets, most recently in the quartet Mixed Nuts in 2024 ([check out my solo song!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2kQ-PaRSFw)).

# Speaking
In 2023, I set myself a goal to establish myself as a speaker and an overall voice in the Laravel community. It's a lofty goal but I'm proud of what I've already done in 2024:
- I helped start the Perth Laravel Meetup, and I regularly host the meetings and present topics
- I submitted a talk proposal to Laracon AU (no luck this year, but I'll work harder for next time)
- I presented a conference talk at DDD Perth
- I started this blog! (Yes, it counts)

# Relaxing
My current obsession is board games. I'm building up quite the collection of board games and [Ikea Kallax shelves](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/7htb48/why_are_kallax_shelves_the_go_to_for_board_gamers/). Some of my favourite games at the moment include Star Wars: Rebellion, Ark Nova, Scythe, Champions of Midgard and Root (mostly games on the heavier side currently, but I have a decent selection of medium-weight games too). Most nights, I spend time with my partner Victoria and our two cats Percy and Widget. We usually play board games, watch TV (my favourite show is Stargate SG-1) or work on creative projects together.

# Creating
Above all, I love to make stuff, especially stuff that other people use and enjoy. Choir Concierge is the best example of that, but recently I've been dabbling in board game design. Maybe you'll hear more about that later...
