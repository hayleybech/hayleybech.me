Making a side hustle is exhausting. It can be hard at times to just sit down and work on it, which is where a bit of well-placed accountability can be crucial.

Yesterday, I attended She Codes' Cosy Coding Sunday, a session for relaxed co-working. It was quiet, with just the right amount of chit-chat to feel welcomed but still get a lot of work done. It's hard to overestimate the value of occasionally getting out of the house and into a different, more focused environment. Especially when the people around you are there to accomplish the same thing.

I want to find more opportunities like this, as I turn my attention to both new projects and existing (but often neglected) side hustles. I thrive in an environment of friendly accountability, and I'm sure there are many of you that do too. Here are some accountability tips that I've learned:

## Body doubling
This is a term from the ADHD community. It simply means either asking someone to be near you whilst being productive themselves, or even involving them in your own task somehow. I use this when I can, but since it depends on another person, you don't want to over-use this technique and put tension on yourr relationship with that person. A lot of forms of accountability work like body doubling - for example, a cosy coding Sunday is essentially body doubling in a larger group.

A partner, close friend or coworker could be an ideal body double. That said, this concept has become so popular that there are [now](https://www.cofocus.one/) [entire](https://www.flow.club/) [websites](https://www.deepwrk.io/) to [find body doubles](https://www.laramates.com/) (ok, that last link was a pair programming site, but it's basically the same thing. Plus, if you're reading this you might be a Laravel developer and should totally check it out).
