Nothing is ever simple in programming. Not even a "simple" bog website. 

I thought the small article list on the home page was great, but I wanted to add a heading to break up the page a little and clarify that the list is just the last few and not the entire collection. Simple, right? Never! I styled the heading with Tailwind, but noticed that the margin was missing. A missing style usually means that I need to re-compile the Tailwind styles (it only compiles classes you're actually using). It threw an error. It turns out my version of Node is outdated. Luckily, updating Node _locally_ turned out to be quite easy.

similar story a bit later, i wanted to add thumbnails. styles worked... locally. after pushing to prod the styles broke. 

- update node in prod
- attempt 1 no dice
- attempt 2 no dice
- trying again with nvm
