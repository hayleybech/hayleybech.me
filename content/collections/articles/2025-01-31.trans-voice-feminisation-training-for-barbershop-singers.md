# Background
## What is Voice Training for Trans people?
### Overview
- voice training / voice femme
- aims to achieve gendered voice without surgery
- speaking voice and/or singing voice
- singing mostly same but requires greater technical control

### How it works
- you are changing your "tone" - the unique qualities of your voice
- tone is partly physical, but mostly is controlled in throat (larynx) and tongue (some control in lips)

features of voice fem:
- changing pitch - important, but pitch alone wont create a fem sound, and lower pitch is easier to maintain when combined with other features
- changing resonance
