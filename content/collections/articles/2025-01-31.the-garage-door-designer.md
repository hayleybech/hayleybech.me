The garage door visualiser, or garage door designer, was a project that Victoria and I built together at Centurion Garage Doors, the workplace where we met. To this day, it's one of the coolest things I've ever made. 

## The proiect
The project, which was Victoria's branchild, allowed customers buying a new garage door to see and customise their door before requesting a measure and quote.

As well as customising the garage door, customers could also upload a photo of their house and, after position the space for the garage, overlay the new garage door on top of the image. We even added a gallery of example homes which allowed some basic colour changes to the walls, so customers could quickly test colour combinations.

## The Code
It took some experimentation to find the right approach to showing the door and houses on the screen. To avoid needing to design a graphic for every single configuration, we choose an approach that showed the door using a series of overlapping layers.
