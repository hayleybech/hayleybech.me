The garage door visualiser, or garage door designer, was a project that Victoria and I built together at Centurion Garage Doors, the workplace where we met. To this day, it's one of the coolest things I've ever made. 

The project, which was Victoria's branchild, allowed customers buying a new garage door to see and customise their door before requesting a measure and quote.
